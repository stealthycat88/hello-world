# hello-world
A place to jot down ideas.

I'm an architectural CAD assistant working in an architectural office creating drawings for healthcare projects.

I'm currently trying to retrain to become a data engineer where I would like to do similar with code what I do with CAD.

Ie. I don't want to run the show but I want to be behind the scenes making sure that it all goes as it should do.
